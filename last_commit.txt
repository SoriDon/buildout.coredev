([51e9077](https://github.com/plone/mockup/commit/51e90776b572575d0367044cb8d5a84140c0b103))\n+This avoids any node_modules subdirectories from linked dependencies to land in the build.\n+\n+* **Build:** Makefile: Only do a build:webpack when make build. Also makes release faster, where we do not need to build the docs - yet.

([f40f64d](https://github.com/plone/mockup/commit/f40f64d17ae3207d90d59390b5430850f1d8b205))\n+backbone.paginator is now in devDependencies as it requests outdated\n+versions of Backbone and Underscore. Having this in normal dependencies\n+field would eventually let backbone.paginator register itself in an\n+outdated Backbone version and make it unavailable by those used in\n+structure pattern.\n+Having this in devDependencies avoids this, but also makes the structure\n+pattern unavailable in add-on bundles unless this dependency is\n+explicitly added.\n+However, this should be fixed in a more sane way. But that\'s out of\n+scope for now.\n+\n ## [5.0.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/plone/mockup/compare/5.0.0-alpha.4...5.0.0-alpha.5) (2022-05-23)\n \n \ndiff --git a/package.json b/package.json\nindex 42d4d0c94..6783abc1a 100644\n--- a/package.json\n+++ b/package.json\n@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@\n {\n     "name": "@plone/mockup",\n-    "version": "5.0.0-alpha.5",\n+    "version": "5.0.0-alpha.6",\n     "description": "A collection of client side patterns for faster and easier web development",\n     "license": "BSD-3-Clause",\n     "main": "./src/patterns.js",\n'
