+Changelog
+=========
+
+2.0.1 (unreleased)
+----------------
+
+Fixes:
+
+- Minor packaging fixes.  [gforcada, maurits]
+
+
+2.0 (2011-06-04)
+----------------
+
+- Update test assertions to avoid deprecation warnings under Python 2.7.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Relicensed to BSD.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Minor PEP8 cleanup.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Exclude tests from the shipped source distribution.
+  [hannosch, iElectric]
+
+2.0b1 (2011-04-03)
+------------------
+
+- Require at least Zope 2.12 / Python 2.6 and add preliminary support for
+  Zope 2.13 with Python 2.6 and 2.7.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.5 (2010-07-18)
+----------------
+
+- Update license to GPL version 2 only.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.4 (2010-05-27)
+----------------
+
+- Fixed some tests that relied on a specific directory layout.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed a bug in dealing with class descriptors, like Five's BoundTemplateFile.
+  We replaced the descriptor with the descriptor result, leading to strange
+  problems. We check for those by looking directly into the ``__dict__`` and
+  comparing it to the result of a normal ``getattr`` call.
+  [hannosch, optilude]
+
+1.3 (2010-01-16)
+----------------
+
+- Use a different hook for providing the initial setup of tracked code files.
+  In Zope 2.12+ there's a proper event published right before the process has
+  started. If this is available we use it, instead of our no longer working
+  approach to hook ``setupFinalLogging``.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.2 (2009-11-21)
+----------------
+
+- Moved the template reloading support into an extra.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added test_suite functions to the test modules.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.1 (2009-10-19)
+----------------
+
+- Added CMF specific functionality: We support explicitly reloading all file
+  system based objects from skins folders while running in production mode.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0 (2009-10-11)
+----------------
+
+- Avoid the `ENABLED` config flag and check against Globals.DevelopmentMode in
+  the browser view.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Make sure the import of the Globals module happens after the variable has
+  been set. This should make it compatible with Zope 2.10.9+.
+  [hannosch]
+
+1.0b1 (2009-08-11)
+------------------
+
+- Got the test coverage for the code reloading part up to 100%.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Fixed reloading of the module scope. The func_globals of functions is now
+  updated with new names introduced into the module scope, so adding new
+  import statements will work.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Specified package dependencies, added development buildout and added
+  extensive test coverage.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Figured out a way to support reloading code that uses decorators.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.11 (2009-05-30)
+-----------------
+
+- Added the z3c.autoinclude entry point so that plone.reload is automatically
+  loaded on Plone 3.3 and above.
+  [optilude]
+
+0.10 (2009-03-22)
+-----------------
+
+- Do not remove attributes from classes when reloading. ZCML directives and
+  other wiring is liable to add attributes to class that will then disappear
+  on reload. This means that if you have removed a class attribute, it will
+  *not* disappear on reload. In this case: restart. :)
+  [optilude]
+
+
+0.9 (2008-07-23)
+----------------
+
+- Removed the manual cleanup approach for extra registries populated by ZCML
+  parsing. Instead we use the registry of cleanup functions inside
+  zope.testing.cleanup to automatically pick up all cleaning functions.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.8 (2008-06-30)
+----------------
+
+- Wrap the setupFinalLogging method of the Zope2 starter objects to initialize
+  our internal modified times registry once after Zope is finished loading.
+  This is the closest I could find that resembles a `Zope is finished loading`
+  event and should help to remove the double-reload behavior.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Only expose the reload view in Zope 2 development mode.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- In case of errors during ZCML reload, restore the original global site
+  manager state, instead of leaving it in a broken state. This allows you to
+  fix and retry the ZCML reload as many times as you need.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.7 (2008-06-17)
+----------------
+
+- Merged the two distinct views into one called @@reload. Added a somewhat
+  nicer UI to it and explain some of the current limitations on that page.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Refactored ZCML loading code a bit. Always do an automatic code reload
+  before reloading ZCML.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed all blacklisting code.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.6 (2008-06-11)
+----------------
+
+- Disabled blacklist until it can be made configurable. The speedup is hardly
+  noticeable anyway, and it can block too much (especially if plone.reload
+  is being used in a lib/python style deployment rather than as an egg).
+  [optilude]
+
+0.5 (2008-05-24)
+----------------
+
+- Merged r20 from http://bazaar.launchpad.net/~refreshng-dev/refreshng/dev.
+  This fixes https://bugs.launchpad.net/refreshng/+bug/175898.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Removed various levels of caching which turned out to be premature and
+  caused lots of modules not to be found.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.4 (2008-03-01)
+----------------
+
+- Made the code reload available as its own @@code_reload view.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Integrated xreload.py from RefreshNG and added a first working version of a
+  general manual code reload feature.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.3 (2008-02-21)
+----------------
+
+- Fixed caching issues by invalidating all ZODB caches. If you have local site
+  managers spread across multiple FileStorages this might still not work as
+  expected.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Added cleanup for CMFCore and PAS.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.2 (2008-01-25)
+----------------
+
+- Added compatibility with Zope 2.10 / Plone 3.0.
+  [hannosch]
+
+0.1 (2008-01-25)
+----------------
+
+- Initial implementation based heavily on Products.RefreshNG.
+  [hannosch]
+
+- Initial package structure.
