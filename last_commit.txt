 Technical overview
 ------------------
 
-Plone is a content management framework that works hand-in-hand and sits on top
-of Zope, a widely-used Open Source web application server and development
-system. To use Plone, you don't need to learn anything about Zope; to develop
-new Plone content types, a small amount of Zope knowledge is helpful, and it is
-covered in the `documentation <http://docs.plone.org>`_.
+Plone is a content management platform written in Python.
+It builds up on Zope, an Open Source web application server and development system and so on the pluggable Zope Component Architecture (ZCA).
 
-Zope itself is written in Python, an easy-to-learn, widely-used and supported
-Open Source programming language. Python can be used to add new features to
-Plone, and used to understand or make changes to the way that Zope and Plone
-work.
